-> Alternative: Use event: for categorization


ðŸ“– Next Learning Steps for SSE
ðŸŒ± 1. Deep Dive into the SSE Protocol

Learn about the SSE event fields (data:, event:, id:, retry:).

Understand auto-reconnection (EventSource automatically reconnects).

Explore Last-Event-ID (resume from where the client left off).

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Implement id: in your SSE messages so if the client disconnects, it can pick up from the last event.

ðŸŒ¿ 2. Custom Events & Event Filtering

Instead of one stream, use event: to send different types (e.g., chat, system, meta).

On the frontend, attach listeners for each event type.

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Modify your chat app so that chat and system events are separated.

ðŸŒ³ 3. Multiple Clients & Broadcasting

Learn to maintain a list of connected clients and send updates to all.

Handle client disconnects (req.is_disconnected() in FastAPI).

Push events to specific users (per-user queue).

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Add usernames so each chat message is broadcasted with sender info.

ðŸŒ² 4. Persistence & Recovery

Store messages in a DB (Postgres/MongoDB).

Use Last-Event-ID to send only missed messages when a client reconnects.

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Add a message history endpoint + reconnect logic.

ðŸŒ´ 5. Scaling & Performance

Optimize SSE with:

Heartbeats (:ping\n\n) to keep connections alive.

Avoid buffering issues (X-Accel-Buffering: no for Nginx).

Handle thousands of concurrent connections (async workers).

Learn when to use SSE vs WebSockets (SSE = simpler, one-way; WebSockets = bidirectional).

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Add heartbeat events and test your app with multiple clients.

ðŸŒµ 6. Security

Add authentication (JWT, API keys, session cookies).

Restrict channels (e.g., only authenticated users get notifications).

Handle CORS for cross-origin EventSource.

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Secure your SSE endpoint with JWT.

ðŸŒº 7. Real-World Integrations

Hook SSE with:

Database triggers (Postgres NOTIFY/LISTEN).

Kafka / RabbitMQ / Redis PubSub.

AI model streaming responses (like OpenAIâ€™s API).

ðŸ‘‰ Task: Stream DB insert events to the frontend.
