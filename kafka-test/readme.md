## 🏗 Kafka Ecosystem Architecture (Simplified)

At a high level, Kafka is like a real-time event streaming platform where data flows between different systems.

```pgsql
   Producers (apps, DBs, logs) ───▶  Kafka  ───▶  Consumers (apps, DBs, analytics)
                                        │
                                   Kafka Connect
                                        │
                 ┌──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┐
                 │                                             │
             Source Connector                             Sink Connector
            (Read from DB → Kafka)                  (Write from Kafka → DB)


```


1. Apache Kafka (the core)

Kafka is a distributed messaging system.
Think of it like a durable, scalable, and real-time queue.

Producer → Sends messages (events) into Kafka topics.

Topic → Like a folder or channel in Kafka where messages are stored.

Partition → Each topic is split into partitions (helps scalability).

Broker → A Kafka server that stores topics/partitions.

Consumer → Reads messages from topics.

📌 Example:

Producer = A web app logs user activity.

Kafka Topic = user-activity.

Consumer = Analytics system that processes the events.
